<!-- E-Commerce Store Capstone Project
This is the README file for the E-Commerce Store Capstone Project. In this project, we have created an online store where users can browse and purchase various products. The project utilizes a public API to fetch product data, provides detailed product information, allows users to add products to their shopping cart, and complete the checkout process. Additionally, we have implemented a category-based product filtering system to enhance the user's shopping experience.

Project Overview
Features
Product Listing: Users can view a list of available products, including product names, images, descriptions, and prices.

Product Details: By clicking on a product, users can access detailed information about the selected item, such as product description and pricing.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart, view the cart contents, update quantities, and remove items.

Checkout: The checkout process enables users to review their cart, input shipping information, and complete the purchase.

Category Filter: A filter feature allows users to search for products based on categories, making it easier to find items of interest.

Technologies Used
React: The project is built using the React JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.

Styled-Components: We use the Styled-Components library to style our components and enhance the visual design.

React Router: For managing routing and navigation within the application.

Context API: We utilize the Context API to manage and share state data such as the shopping cart across different components.

Fetch API: The Fetch API is used to fetch product data from a public API.
